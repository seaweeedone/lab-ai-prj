## Language & Framework
- Backend : python3.10 + fastapi
- Frontend : React

## Development Rules
- Environment : Create and use a Conda virtual environment.
- Management: Manage packages using requirements.txt.

## Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- File & Directory Naming :
  - Use snake_case for file names (e.g., user_router.py).
  - Organize by feature/module (e.g., routers/, schemas/, services/, models/, core/, utils/).
- Variables, functions, and me****thods: Use lowercase letters with underscores (e.g., my_variable). 
- Classes: Use CamelCase (e.g., MyClass). 
- Constants: Use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE).****

### Code Conventions:
- Code Dir : ../app
- Indent : 4 spaces per indentation level (do not use tabs)
- Line Length: Limit each line to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Whitespace Usage:
  - Do not add spaces inside parentheses (), braces {}, or brackets []. 
  - Do not use a space before commas, colons, or semicolons; use one space after them. 
- Blank Lines:
  - Use 2 blank lines before and after function and class definitions. 
  - Use 1 blank line between method definitions within a class. 
- Comments:
  - Use clear and concise comments to describe the purpose and behavior of the code.
- Type Hints :
  - Use type hints for all function arguments and return types.
- Docstrings :
  - Use Google-style docstrings to document functions and classes.
- Configuration:
  - Store sensitive information like API keys in `../app/common/constants.py`.
  - This file should be included in `.gitignore` and not committed to version control.
- Pydantic Models :
  - Separate request/response models (e.g., UserCreate, UserRead).
  - Enable orm_mode in Config when using with ORM models.
- Router & Service Separation :
  - Keep business logic inside service modules.
  - Routers should only handle request/response and call service functions.
- Dependency Injection :
  - Use FastAPI's Depends with reusable functions for testability.
- HTTP Status Codes :
  - Use appropriate status codes with FastAPI’s response decorators.
- Exception Handling :
  - Define custom exception classes.
  - Use FastAPI’s exception_handler or middleware for global error handling.
- Logging :
  - Use the logging module (do not use print()).
- Async Usage :
  - Use async def for endpoints and services when performing I/O operations.
- Testing :
  - Use pytest framework.
  - Place tests in the tests/ directory.
  - Name test files as test_*.py and functions as test_*.
- Linting & Formatting :
  - Use ruff, black, and mypy for linting and formatting.

### Database Convention 
  - Local Development :
    - Use SQLite as the default database for local development and testing.
  - ORM Model :
    - Use CamelCase for class names and snake_case for table names.
    - Always declare `__tablename__` explicitly.
    - Define all field names using snake_case.
    - Table and column names should be descriptive and easily identifiable.
      (e.g., use `user_email` instead of just `email`)
  - Base Model :
    - Use a shared Base class with common fields like `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
  - Relationships :
    - Use `relationship()` with `back_populates` for bi-directional relationships.
    - Foreign keys should be clearly named and explicitly declared (e.g., `user_id`).
  - Naming :
    - Use consistent naming conventions for all tables (e.g., all plural or all singular).
    - All column names must be descriptive and in snake_case.
  - Async DB Access :
    - Use `AsyncSession` with context managers for database operations.
    - Avoid performing database logic directly in routers; use service layer instead.
  - Schema Separation :
    - Separate Pydantic models from ORM models.
    - Use `orm_mode = True` in Pydantic response models when returning ORM objects.
  - Migration :
    - Use Alembic for managing schema migrations.
    - Use clear and consistent naming for migration scripts (e.g., `add_users_table`).
    - Avoid modifying autogenerated migration files unless absolutely necessary.

## Documentation Rules :
  - Language: Korean
  - README :
    - Create a `README.md` file when development is complete.
    - The README must include:
      - Project or module purpose
      - Directory structure and key file descriptions
      - Feature descriptions and usage scenarios
      - How to set up and run the application (e.g., environment setup, command examples)
  - Writing Style :
    - Use clear, concise, and consistent language.
    - Use markdown headings, code blocks, and bullet points for readability.
    - Include diagrams or flowcharts if needed (e.g., using mermaid or image links).
  - Updates :
    - Update the documentation if features or structure change.
    - Keep setup instructions in sync with actual code/configuration.
